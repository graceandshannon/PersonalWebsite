				<p> My name is Grace Huntowski and I am currently a junior majoring in Graphic Design with a minor in Marketing. One of the classes I enjoyed the most my sophomore year was Introduction to Web Design. I really enjoyed coding in the class and exploring different variations or ways to code. With this class, I hope to continue to explore and learn about new ways to code and become more confident in my coding ability. Other classes I am taking this semester include Design History and Visual Communications 2.  </p>

				<p> A passion of mine is color guard. I have been a part of the marching band here at Millersville for the past 3 years and I also instruct color guard at Hempfield High School which is about 20 minutes from campus. The past two summers I also had the opportunity to march in a drum and bugle corps called the Reading Buccaneers and I was able to spend my entire summer doing what I love alongside all of my friends. </p>

				<p> A have two favorite Design classes I have taken so far. The first class is what I talked about previously which was Introduction to Web Design. Another class I enjoyed from last fall semester was Material Design. This class helped me think outside the box and apply my design to different materials such as paper and wood. It was really fun to think about my design in terms of three dimensional rather than on a screen. Overall both classes allowed me to think outside of the box and I really enjoyed all the projects I created. </p> </div>

				<p> A few of my hobbies include reading and cooking. Another thing I absolutely love along with reading and cooking is traveling. I love going on adventures whether they're small ones or traveling to places in or outside of the United States. I have been to many places within the US but outside of it I have gone to England, Spain and this summer I will be going to the Galapagos Islands. It is really interesting to me to see different historical landmarks, how people live, the architecture and scenery around the world. It is also very interesting to see how art and design change in different places based off of the culture and people. </p> </div>
